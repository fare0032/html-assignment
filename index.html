        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My full name is Jessica Fares and I was born in Ottawa, Ontario. My birthday is July 21<sup>st</sup> 2002, which makes me 20 years old. My horoscope sign is a cancer and my favourite color is blue like the sky. My ethnicity is Lebanese, my parents are from Lebanon and they moved here about 25 years ago. My hobbies include watching Netflix and Disney Plus. My passions in life are: singing, acting and dancing.
        </p>
        <p> I've been singing since I was little, I have always enjoyed music and it's nice to put myself in someone else's position when singing the lyrics and hearing what they go through. I also feel like it would be very dull if we didn't have it. For me, acting is pretending to be someone else, putting yourself in someone else's shoes. I feel very connected and really let myself have a dual persona. When I am dancing, I let go, I am stress free and I feel like nobody's watching, it's just me in the room letting loose, without having a care in the world. So that's me, I'm fun, sensitive and honest. 
        </p>
        <p> A quote that most inspires me is: "Be yourself, everyone else is already taken." said by Oscar Wilde.
            That really inspired me to never change for anyone. If you don't like me for me then that's too bad for you, because I love myself, and that's how it should be.  </p>
